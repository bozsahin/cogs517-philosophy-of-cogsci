This is the repo for the course above at METU when i teach it.

The repo includes lecture notes, papers, and syllabus (this file).

It is required that you clone (git command that is `git clone') and monitor this repo ('git pull'). <b>Learn git basics  as soon as possible. Git culture is great for organizing work, and doing team work. It has become part of the toolkit for scientific work</b>.

LECTURER: Cem Bozsahin (Fall 2022) Office hours: TBA

TA: TBA

LECTURES: Tuesdays 11.40-14.30. 

BACKGROUND REQUIREMENTS: Basic understanding of cognitive science at the level of COGS501 and COGS502. Or some backgorund in philosophy or AI.

COURSE IN RELATION TO THE PROGRAM: It is a departmental elective course in the Philosophy track of Cognitive Science. It can be taken as elective by other departments.

COURSE OBJECTIVES: One can study these topics in the philosophical tradition, as philosophy of mind. One can also see the contents as philosophy for cognitive science, i.e. covering schools and practices of philosophy for the benefit of the cognitive scientist. This course is neither. It is about the philosophy of cognitive science from the inside, as cognitive scientists encounter scientific and philosophical problems, more like in a philosophy of science tradition, except that it's covered by a scientist rather than a philosopher in current offering.

So, why this course? Remember: We wouldn't need CogSci if Cognitive Psychology were successful. We wouldn't need CogSci if AI were successful. We wouldn't need CogSci if Philosophy of Mind were successful. We wouldn't need CogSci if the so-called Cognitive Revolution in Linguistics were successful. Inquiring minds want to know why they failed (to deliver).

Although we spend good amount of time on the mind-body problem, this is NOT a philosophy of mind course. In other words, we're not
ONLY interested in this problem. We try to understand philosophical implications of postulating mechanisms for complex problems that natural minds seem to be able to deal with, and probably outsource some of that to artificial minds once they are relatively well understood.

COURSE OUTLINE: 

W1-2: Introduction: A bit of philosophy of Science/Mind before Philosophy of Cogsci

W3-5: Turing, Marr, and the Explanatory role of computers for the mind

W6-14: Topics To be determined from the reader.


COURSE CONDUCT: W1-5 lectures. W6-W14 are presentations by students about one of the papers in the reader. Short weekly quiz during class, in the beginning or the end. Essay writing throughout the term.

TEXTBOOK: None. There is a course reader which includes required readings for everyone.

The reader contains work by Turing, Marr, Fodor, Dennett, Newell, Simon, Putnam, Searle, Chalmers, Dermott, Sloman, Clark, Pollock,
Bechtel, Churchland, Aaronson, Smolensky, Haugeland, Tomasello, and my papers related to subject which form the basis of my lecture notes.
